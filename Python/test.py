I might start using this more often for mobile programming :)

#This is a test to see if vim chromebook can edit this file :)

#This is and enless loop so yeah
#while (True):
#   system("say hi")



#This will run only this program, but has a limit on number of times so I added the line at the end to make it endless
#for x in range(0,1000000):
#    system("say hi")
#system("python test.py")



#This will run the program over and over again, VERY INEFFICIENT
#system("say hi")
#system("python test.py")
